<p>Modernism in branding and clothing</p>
<p>The value of an object</p>
<p>Is luxury still important anymore? First we had couture, then we had ready-to-wear, and now we have streetwear… How is it possible that the fashion industry shift paradigms so quickly? How can just one brand change (dismantle codes) the whole fashion industry — like OFF-WHITE, VETEMENTS, etc? Where is the need of collaborating between two brands, like Louis Vuitton and Supreme did, or Karl Lagerfeld and Vance? Where is the copy-paste logic of streetwear came from? Is it the same logic as the modernist practice of montage? Is being a fashion designer necessarily still, or is it all a form of remixing and editing? (Good resource would be: “Learning from Las Vegas" by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown. Discourse about postmodernism in general could be useful).</p> 

<p>First of all, fashion in general holds a personal importance to me. When I was a child, I presented myself as being older in the way I dress. I always was inspired by fashion shows — the music, people, and entire atmosphere. The last couple of years I have seen a total collapse in the way codes are built in fashion. Five to ten years ago, for me it was always kind of easy to dress myself up. Today, it is super difficult to be different and unique in what you wear. For example, I bought the first Raf Simons x Adidas sneakers. At that time, there was actually no one (besides of course fashion people), who understood how strange and coveted that sneaker was. But in the last couple of years, social media has grown fashion to the point where, if there’s a new sneaker, it’s posted online and immediately consumed on a global level. It’s scary to think that the rate at which we consume is now faster than the rate at which designers can design. And it’s scary to think that ideas are crowd-sourced to the point where many fashion shows look the same. And it’s scary to think that the gulf between what something costs and what something is has widened to the point where a brand can sell a t-shirt with DHL on the front for 350eu. But if fashion as we knew it before is dying, is this necessarily a bad thing? What other opportunities does it create? I think many of the fashion we see know is designed in a way that shows other people how to do it. I think everyone can make fashion, you just only have to find a good printer, apparel and of course a good taste. (Bauhaus, open course).</p>

<p>I am curious about the mechanics of how the fashion industry can change so fast and the details of the direction where is is going. How is social media connected to fashion? How does fashion psychologically connect us to each other? What is the reason why big brands like H&M, ZARA and MANGO copy paste streetwear into their own collections? Why is it cool to wear a band t-shirt, when you don’t listen to the band? How do these developments related to aesthetics ideas that have already been developed in modernism and postmodernism? In many ways fashion in an industry that digest previous ideas in architecture and art, and I am curious what it will brings to the future.<p>
